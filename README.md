## Summary: 
We can input specific criteria including date, city, country and shape and the webpage can automatically generate a new table list. However, there is still some spaces to improve. For example, I would like to improve the filter design. First of all, since there are only two countries in the pool, I would like to change the type-in function into the selection chart for user-friendly purpose. Secondly, regarding the date searching, I would like to enable the webpage to be able to filter the data based on defined period of date instead of one specific date. Then, we can search the data within certain period of date and list the result in one table.
